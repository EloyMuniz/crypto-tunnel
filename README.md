# 🔐 Crypto Tunnel

Crypto Tunnel is a Node.js-based HTTPS server project designed to simulate secure communication using TLS encryption. This project runs locally, using self-signed certificates, and helps you understand how low-level HTTPS communication works — including cryptographic concepts using the Node.js `crypto` module.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ HTTPS server using Express
- ✅ Self-signed TLS certificates for local testing
- ✅ Dockerized environment (development and production)
- ✅ Node.js + TypeScript setup
- ✅ Secure communication simulation between client and container server
- ✅ Optional usage of Node.js `crypto` for custom encryption
